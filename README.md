## About:
A "**Mind Games**" is a collection of five simple console games. Each game asks questions that must be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Wrong answers end the game and prompt you to play it again.

### Games:
- **Brain-Even**: Determining an even number.
- **Brain-Calc**: Arithmetic expressions to be calculated.
- **Brain-Gcd**: Calculating the greatest common factor.
- **Brain-Progression**: Searching for missing numbers in the arithmetic progression of numbers.
- **Brain-Prime**: Definition of a prime number.
